This is an XMLRPC Server meant to reside on the Landsat online cache machines.  

It provides an EROS internal API for clients to determine if scenes are present and available to be downloaded.  

This was built because the previous method of determining online cache contents was to maintain a full copy of filenames client-side (in ESPA) in memcached.  

This could only be run periodically due to the execution time, was placing undue strain on the online cache machines, and introduced unnecessary lag in order production and fulfillment.

This server allows callers to supply a list of scenes as an input parameter and receive a list in return, which contains only the supplied scenes that are on cache, excluding ones not present.

There are no external dependencies for this server other than a standard python installation (version 2.4 through 2.7.x) and the code in the source directory.

To test this module, install nose and execute: nosetests --with-coverage scene_cache.py
